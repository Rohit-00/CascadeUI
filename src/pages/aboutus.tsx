        I lied there's no 'us' it's only <a href="https://x.com/byir0nic" target="_blank" className="text-blue-500">me</a>. I'm newbie a Web developer. I don't know if 
        I can call myself an android or an IOS developer if I develop apps using react native but I like react native and wanted to create a ui library which 
        consists of animated components, so that you don't have to create one from scratch. These components are handmade by me and I'm planning to make more components
        . If you wanna know what component I'm working on, follow me on twitter. If you like/hate any of the components feel free to dm and give suggestions.
